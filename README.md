# My Portfolio Website
This is my portfolio website, built with plain html,css and js.
It containes my name, a bit about myself, my projects and the option to contact me on a range of platforms.

It is all on a single page, which i quite liked the style of. You can take a look [here](https://br3nd0g.github.io/portfolio/).

## What I Learnt
When making this, I used a lot of things i already had good knowledge of. The one thing I learnt when making this was using text-shadow and box-shadow, which I quite like the look of.

## Next Steps
In the future I think i may update my portfolio, perhaps with an entire different look, or eventually with more projects to show off, a whole seperate page for projects.

## UPDATE

This site is slowly becoming outdated in relevance to my current skillset, and the effectiveness and maintainability. I will most likely update it to a whole new page soon in the future.
